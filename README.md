# Surprise-Housing-casestudy

**Abstract**
	This project is a case study of predicting housing prices using data science techniques. I applied lasso regression and ridge regression to create a linear model that can account for the effects of various features on the housing market. I compared the performance of the two methods and evaluated their strengths and weaknesses. I also discussed the implications of the results for the housing industry and the potential applications of the model for other domains.

“The dataset I have used in this project is train.csv from Kaggle”

**Objective**
	The primary objective of the Surprise Housing Case Study is to develop a robust regression model that accurately predicts the actual value of residential properties in the Australian market. The study aims to achieve the following:

1.	Feature Selection: Identify the most influential variables that significantly impact house prices. These features may include factors such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, amenities, and neighbourhood characteristics.

2.	Model Creation: Build a predictive model using both Lasso regression and Ridge regression techniques. These regularization methods help mitigate overfitting and enhance the model’s generalization ability.

3.	Performance Evaluation: Assess the performance of the regression models on both training and test datasets. Compare the results of Lasso and Ridge regression to determine which approach yields better predictions.

4.	Business Insights: Provide actionable insights to Surprise Housing for making informed investment decisions. The model’s accuracy and interpretability will guide the company in identifying undervalued properties and maximizing potential profits.

**Introduction**
	Surprise Housing, a US-based real estate company, has set its sights on the Australian market. With a keen eye for undervalued properties, the company aims to purchase homes below their actual market worth and subsequently sell them at a profit. To achieve this, Surprise Housing seeks data-driven insights and predictive models that can guide their investment decisions.



In this case study, we delve into the world of data science, exploring the intricacies of housing prices, influential factors, and regression techniques. Our focus lies on two powerful regularization methods: Lasso regression and Ridge regression. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, we aim to create a robust model that accurately predicts house prices, enabling Surprise Housing to make informed choices.

**Methodology**

**Data Collection and Exploration:**
•	Obtain the dataset (e.g., Train.csv) containing information about properties.
•	Explore the data to understand its structure, missing values, and potential features.

**Feature Engineering:**
•	Identify relevant features (variables) that may impact house prices.
•	Handle missing data (impute or drop).
•	Create new features if necessary (e.g., total area, age of the property).

**Data Preprocessing:**
•	Standardize or normalize numerical features.
•	Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
•	Split the data into training and validation sets.

**Model Building:**
•	Use regularized regression techniques (Ridge and Lasso) to build predictive models.
•	Tune hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength) using cross-validation.
•	Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

**Conclusion**
	In this project, we explored the intricate world of housing prices, leveraging data science techniques to empower Surprise Housing’s investment decisions. Let’s recap the key takeaways:
1.	Regression Models:
o	We built two powerful regression models: Lasso regression and Ridge regression.
o	Both models demonstrated decent performance, with Lasso slightly outperforming Ridge.
o	These models allow us to predict house prices accurately, aiding Surprise Housing in identifying undervalued properties.
2.	Feature Insights:
o	Significant variables impacting house prices include location, square footage, amenities, and neighborhood characteristics.
o	Coefficients from the models highlight the importance of these features.
3.	Business Recommendations:
o	Surprise Housing should focus on properties with favorable features.
o	Prioritize neighborhoods with growth potential.
o	Continuously monitor market trends and adjust investment strategies accordingly.
